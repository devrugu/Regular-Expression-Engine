# Regular-Expression-Engine
A small JavaScript based regular expression engine that demonstrates
pattern searching with NFA and DFA techniques.  Only a limited subset
of regular expression syntax is implemented but it is enough to show
how state machines work.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` or `indexC.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Enter a regular expression and the text to search.
3. Click **NFA** to run the matcher and view the results under the
   search box.

Currently the engine supports literals, `+`, `*`, parentheses and `|`.
